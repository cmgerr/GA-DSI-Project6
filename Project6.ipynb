       "u'Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowdpleasing intensity On the surface its a gritty story about a brutal studentmentor relationship that oversteps boundaries Underneath its a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing As a result its the best film Ive seen in years and I say that without hesitation This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts If writerdirector Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist then he has achieved it   Miles Teller whos been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now stars as Andrew Neyman a 19yearold aspiring jazz drummer whos pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher played by the ferocious JK Simmons like weve never seen him before Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker Theyre urgently looking for the next Parker in search of perfection But with that comes a great irony The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters Even so Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself you get a feel for what hes looking for and when someones wrong even if you dont know why Simmons is as good as they say he is Hes a force of nature with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White But its not a onenote performance Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness insecurity approachability and he also sometimes brings in the lightness hes known for in other roles with Jason Reitman exec producer here   Even though hes an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say hes still somewhat endearing and enigmatic much like R Lee Ermeys drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether its a crime or an ends justifying the means factor of life Its not just a music film but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that were not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me His poisonous words are more a part of Andrews psyche than legitimate coaching techniques What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing What is objectively great in art When is it good enough and why It toes a fascinating line Thats why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because its so instinctive Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat Tellers performance as Andrew is terrific one to match Simmons   Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived Its the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrews head however Its a long road to the top but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals It does appear to be very antipositive reinforcement but perhaps its merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring Whiplash is refreshing to see we all know we wouldnt be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so its cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far hell go His frustration regrets fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as hes pushed further and further   The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography Its thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements Theres a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere but its so rich in emotion psychological tension and personal subtext It neither rushes nor drags on paper nor on screen It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days nagging you like Fletcher over your shoulder Maybe itll continue to linger for weeks I hope so too especially for Oscar voters It seems that JK Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point However Whiplash isnt just a best of year film nor best of decade It approaches best of alltime worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics fulfilling aspirations resilience of the soul and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor Ill take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator  1010 Best film of the decade  Read more  The Awards Circuit httpwwwawardscircuitcom'"
